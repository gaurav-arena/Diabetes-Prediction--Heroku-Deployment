# Diabetes-Prediction--Heroku-Deployment
This repository is about deploying a Diabetes Prediction ML model using Flask on Heroku. 

Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also a creator of other different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness, kidney diseases, etc. Therefore early detection can make an impact. The normal identifying process would involve patient to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. But with the rise of Machine Learning approaches we have the ability to find a solution to this issue, we have developed a system using data mining which has the ability to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.

The dataset used in the model is PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset and is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Steps Involved: 
1. Train our Diabetes Predictor ML model
2. Create Web app using Flask
3. Commit the code in GitHub
4. Create an account on Heroku
5. Link Github with heroku
6. Deploy the model on heroku
